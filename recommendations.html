<h2>Travel Tips by City:</h2>
	
	<h3 class="barcelonah">Barcelona, Spain</h3>
	<img src="images/park_guell.jpg" id="park_guell" alt="Picture of Park Guell, Barcelona">
	
	<p class="barcelonap">In Barcelona I recommend you adventure around the different neighborhoods. You can walk through beautiful cathedrals, taste fresh seafood paella, and experience the cultural works of Antoni Gaudi at La Sagrada Familia, in town, parks, and all around the city. Be careful around Las Ramblas, it's a tourist trap!</p>
	
	<h3 class="viennah">Vienna, Austria</h3>
	
	<img src="images/vienna.jpg" id="vienna" alt="Picture of Lexi in front of St. Stephen's Cathedral">
	
	<p class="viennap">Vienna has beautiful castles and art museums that can make hours feel like minutes. I recommend you try some cultural food, my favorite was weiner schnitzel, and explore the markets and tours the city has to offer. My friends and I took a free walking tour and learned so much about the Habsburg Empire!</p>
	
	<h3 class="amsterdamh">Amsterdam, The Netherlands</h3>
	
	<img src="images/amsterdam.jpg" id="amsterdam" alt="Picure of Lexi in front of Amsterdam canal">
	
	<p class="amsterdamp">Amsterdam is a beautiful city! Take in the views from one of the hundreds of canal bridges and enjoy cultural foods like stoop waffles. I recommend planning your trip around when the tuplips bloom because they are a gorgeous sight to see! Also try to visit the Anne Frank House and take a boat tour if possible.</p>
	
	<h3 class="lisbonh">Lisbon, Portugal</h3>
	
	<img src="images/pena_palace.jpg" id="lisbon" alt="Picture of Lexi at Pena Palace in Portugal">
	
	<p class="lisbonp">Lisbon is an underrated city and has incredible history and culture to offer visitors. The hilly city has cobblestone roads and shops up and down each street. Nearby is a city called Sintra is home to the famous Pena Palace and Moorish Castle. If you have extra time, I recommend taking a trolley tour!</p>
	
	<h3 class="parish">Paris, France</h3>
	
	<img src="images/paris.jpg" id="paris" alt="Picture of Lexi in front of Eiffel Tower, France">
	
	<p class="parisp">Paris is home to the Eiffel Tower, countless delicious pastries, and more beautiful art and architecture than one could imagine. Take a day to explore the Lourve and Arc de Triumph, and treat yourself to a croissant and beret! Definitely leave extra time at the airport because its layout is incredibly confusing if you don't speak French.</p>
	
	<h3 class="londonh"> London, England</h3>
	
	<img src="images/london.jpg" id="london" alt="Picture of Big Ben, London">
	
	<p class="londonp">London is the land of red phone booths and delightful accents. There is a mix of shopping, royal palaces and grounds, double-decker buses, fresh markets, and tourist sights. Experiening the Changing of the Guard at the Palace is something I wish I could have done! The tube is the main form of transportation and it is a really cool experience! Pro tip: bring an umbrella!</p>
	
	<h3 class="copenhagenh">Copenhagen, Denmark</h3>
	
	<img src="images/copenhagen.jpg" id="copenhagen" alt="Picture of Lexi on ferris wheel in Copenhagen">
	
	<p class="copenhagenp">Copenhagen architecture makes up for the gray skies. The colorful buildings are iconic and the canals are a sight to see. I learned "<em>tak</em>" is how you say thank you, and the locals were happy to see my attempt at Danish! The pastries were surprisingly delicious, so definitely get a Danish cinnamon bun if you can.</p>
	
	<h3 class="romeh">Rome, Italy</h3>
	
	<img src="images/italy.jpg" id="rome" alt="Picture of Lexi in front of the Roman Forum">
	
	<p class="romep">In Rome you absolutely need to experience the Roman Forum, throw a coin in the Trevi Fountain, and take a picture by the Colosseum. The history is alive, and the views taste much better with fresh pizza, pasta, and gelato in hand! I took an incredible cooking class where I learned to make pasta and tiramisu. Go to Rome to develop a love for cooking! </p>
	
	<h3 class="athensh">Athens, Greece</h3>
	
	<img src="images/greece.jpg" id="athens" alt="Picture of Lexi at the Acropolis in Greece">
	
	<p class="athensp">Athens is a mix of history and urban city. The Acropolis in Athens brings you back to the days of ancient Greeks teaching mathematics and spreading peace, but the main city center with lively shopping centers and bustling restaurants is like any popular European city. This dichotomy gives tourists the best of both worlds. Try to try as many new dishes as you can!</p>
