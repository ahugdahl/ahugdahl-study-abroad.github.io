	 	<p class="one">My name is Lexi Hugdahl and I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Last spring I had the opportunity to study abroad in Barcelona!</p>
		<p class="two">In Spain, I had the absolute pleasure of learning about the Spanish culture and language. I attended business classes with American students and Spanish natives.</p>

	<p class="three">My learnings did not stop in the classroom! I was fortunate enough to have traveled to 9 countries during my time in Europe and each new experience broadened my perspective.</p>
	<p class="four">I believe every student able to study abroad absolutely should take the leap and experience something new!</p>
